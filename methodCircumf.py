# Print the circumference for circles with a radius of 2, 5, and 7

# In this example, there is a class named Circle.
# Classes will be discussed later. circumference
# and printCircumference are the names of the
# method in the class. These methods returns the
# value of the circumferenceValue to the code
# that called the method.
